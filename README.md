# Portfolio

## Portfolio Description
This is my personal portfolio and I decided to build it from a blank canvas using HTML and CSS. I chose to build it this way for several reasons but mainly because of the freedom and creativity you can incorporate into it rather than being limited to do certain things if you were to build it off a template. I highlighted a few sections in my portfolio such as: About Me, Skills, Projects, Contact Info. 

 ** This is a still a work in progress and plan on building it up even more from here. Stay tuned!! **
